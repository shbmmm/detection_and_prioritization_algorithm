# Detection and Prioritization Algorithm

Welcome to the Detection and Prioritization Algorithm repository! This project comprises various Python scripts designed to compute Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data changes and remap them to visualize drastic changes. Our tool is simple yet powerful, providing quick and actionable insights into significant environmental events.

## Key Features

- **Efficient SAR Data Processing**: Our scripts efficiently process SAR data to detect significant changes in the environment.
- **Visualization of Drastic Changes**: The tool remaps the processed data to visualize areas with drastic changes, making it easy to identify and prioritize affected regions.
- **Wide Range of Applications**: From monitoring natural disasters like bushfires and forest fires to other environmental changes, our tool shows promising results in various scenarios.

## Applications

### Australian Bushfires
Our tool has been used to analyze the devastating Australian bushfires, helping to quickly identify the most affected areas and prioritize emergency response efforts.

### New Jersey Forest Fires
Similarly, our tool has shown effective results in monitoring and assessing the impact of forest fires in New Jersey.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/detection_and_prioritization_algorithm.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd detection_and_prioritization_algorithm
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Prepare your SAR data in the appropriate format.
2. Run the main script to process the data and generate visualizations:

```bash
python main_script.py
```

3. Check the output directory for the generated visualizations.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the tool with a sample SAR dataset:

```bash
python main_script.py --input data/sample_sar_data --output results/visualizations
```
